# Overview

This is my Java word and number guessing games! I wanted to use 

I wanted to learn how the coding langage Java works and how it is diffrent from other languges I've used in the past

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Microsofts VS Code and a Java extention called JDK.

Java is object-oriented language that can be ran anywhere on a device that has Java Virtual Machine or JVM on it. They can run on any platform incuding Linux, Apple OS, and Windows without changing anything to the code. The libraries I used in this project was Scanner (java.util.scanner), Random (java.util.Random), Set (java.util.Set) and HashSet (java.util.HashSet). Scanner is used to read inputs from things like keyboards and files. Random generates random numbers for the number guessing game. Set and HashSet is used to check what letters the user already used.

# Future Work

- Work on adding difficulty settings (Hard,Medium,Easy). Bigger/smaller words and make it easeir to guess the number so I can add a larger range of numbers
- Add a scoring system. Points for how fast users guess each letter, words and numbers.
- Add a timer so users can't sit and think for so long to add more stress to the game maybe making it more difficult to guess letters or numbers.
